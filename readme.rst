TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
#########################

########
ABSTRACT 
########

Conventional Traffic light systems operate on a timing mechanism that changes the light signals after a given interval programmed on the implementation of the system. Furthermore, this technique of traffic management was quickly found as an inadequate method in case it comes to manage cars when roads are approximately free. An intelligent traffic light system senses the presence,estimate the traffic level and reacts accordingly. The idea behind intelligent traffic systems is that drivers will not spend unnecessary time waiting for the traffic lights to change signals while ways are free to go. An intelligent traffic system detects traffic in many different ways. Similarly, to increase the practicability of the system, we aimed to add advanced functionality and make it an all-in-one traffic management system. We will implement a contact-less car speed sensing, traffic level estimation algorithm and licence plate recognition for drivers who attempt to break driving law or road safety rules. Due to the greatness of data to process and real time CPU infrastructure demand, we proposed the use of Raspberry Pie Cortex computer to power the all system in synchronization with AI Cloud computing SAAS (Software As Service) Due to affordability of Raspberry Pie along with the journey of the realization, we will develop a prototype using a regular PC running Such IOT framework to overlap the need of the embedded computer which should be used on production. 

#Briefly, applying this system will help: on one side, the country to ensure that safety rules are observed, reduces traffic accident; on the other side it helps to smarten traffic management

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

*******************
Release Information
*******************

This repo contains in-development code for future releases. To download the
latest stable release please visit the `CodeIgniter Downloads
<https://codeigniter.com/download>`_ page.

**************************
Changelog and New Features
**************************

You can find a list of all changes for each release in the `user
guide change log <https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/develop/user_guide_src/source/changelog.rst>`_.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
