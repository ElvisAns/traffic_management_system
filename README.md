# TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Conventional Traffic light systems operate on a timing mechanism that changes the light signals after a given interval programmed on the implementation of the system. Furthermore, this technique of traffic management was quickly found as an inadequate method in case it comes to manage cars when roads are approximately free.     
An intelligent traffic light system senses the presence,estimate the traffic level and reacts accordingly. The idea behind intelligent traffic systems is that drivers will not spend unnecessary time waiting for the traffic lights to change signals while ways are free to go. 
An intelligent traffic system detects traffic in many different ways. For us we will use induction loop. 
Similarly, to increase the practicability of the system, we aimed to add advanced functionality and make it an all-in-one traffic management system. We will implement a contact-less car speed sensing, traffic level estimation algorithm and licence plate recognition for drivers who attempt to break driving law or road safety rules. Due to the greatness of data to process  and real time CPU infrastructure demand, we proposed the use of Raspberry Pie Cortex computer to power the all system in synchronization with AI Cloud computing SAAS (Software As Service)  Due to affordability of Raspberry Pie along with the journey of the realization, we will develop a prototype using a regular PC running Such IOT framework to overlap the need of the embedded computer which should be used on production.
Briefly, applying this system will help: on one side, the country to ensure that safety rules are observed, reduces traffic  accident; on the other side it helps to smarten traffic management.
